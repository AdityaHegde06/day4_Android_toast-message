# Toast Messages in Android

This project demonstrates how to display simple `Toast` messages in an Android app. Toasts are used to provide feedback to the user for a short period without blocking interaction.

## Features

- Displaying `Toast` messages for user actions (e.g., button clicks).
- Example includes two buttons for uploading and downloading data, each showing a respective `Toast` message.

## Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** installed.
- **Kotlin** programming language.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdityaHegde06/day4_Android_toast-message/tree/main


Key Functions
Toast.makeText(context, text, duration): Creates a toast message.
context: The context in which the application is running.
text: The text message to display.
duration: The length of time to display the message, e.g., Toast.LENGTH_SHORT or Toast.LENGTH_LONG.
How It Works
Buttons: There are two buttons, one for downloading and one for uploading. When clicked, a corresponding Toast message appears at the bottom of the screen.

Toast Display: The Toast.makeText() function is called within the onClickListener of each button. The message is displayed for a short duration (Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).
